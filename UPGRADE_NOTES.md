- Configured proper networking between services

#### Nginx Configuration
- Created `docker/nginx/default.conf` for serving Laravel application
- Configured FastCGI to communicate with PHP-FPM container

### 3. Laravel Framework Updates

#### Core Files
- **bootstrap/app.php**: Completely rewritten for Laravel 12's new structure using `Application::configure()`
- **routes/web.php**: Updated to use modern Route facade syntax and array-based controller references
- **composer.json**: Updated all dependencies to Laravel 12 compatible versions

#### Dependencies Updated
- laravel/framework: 5.3.* → ^12.0
- laravel/tinker: Added ^2.10
- laravel/sanctum: Added ^4.0
- phpunit/phpunit: 5.6.3 → 11.5.42
- And many other supporting packages

#### Application Structure
- **Models**: Moved User model from `app/User.php` to `app/Models/User.php`
- Added `HasFactory` trait to User model
- Updated User model to use modern property type hints and casts() method
- Updated password hashing to use 'hashed' cast

#### Database
- **Seeders**: Moved from `database/seeds/` to `database/seeders/` namespace
- Updated seeder classes with proper namespacing (`Database\Seeders`)
- Updated return type declarations from `void` to proper type hints

### 4. Configuration Files

#### config/app.php
- Simplified configuration for Laravel 12
- Removed manual service provider and alias registration (now auto-discovered)
- Added new Laravel 12 configurations:
  - maintenance mode driver
  - previous_keys for key rotation
  - faker_locale

### 5. Frontend Build System

#### Package Management
- Removed Laravel Mix/Elixir
- Added Vite as the new build tool
- Updated package.json with:
  - vite: ^5.0
  - laravel-vite-plugin: ^1.0
  - axios: ^1.7.4

#### Asset Structure
- Created `vite.config.js` for Vite configuration
- Updated asset paths:
  - `resources/assets/js/` → `resources/js/`
  - `resources/assets/sass/` → `resources/css/`
- Created modern `resources/js/bootstrap.js` with Axios setup
- Created `resources/css/app.css` for styles

### 6. Code Refactoring

#### Repositories
- Updated `app/Repositories/UserRepository.php` to use `App\Models\User`
- Changed `use DB;` to `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;`

#### Removed Deprecated Code
- Removed Laravel 5.3 specific middleware configurations
- Removed old service providers no longer needed in Laravel 12
- Updated middleware definitions (now configured in bootstrap/app.php)

### 7. Compatibility Notes

#### Breaking Changes
The following files show syntax errors in the current PHP 7.2 environment but are correct for PHP 8.3:
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Uses named arguments (PHP 8.0+ feature)
- `config/app.php` - Uses spread operator in array (PHP 7.4+ feature)

These will work correctly once running under PHP 8.3 in the Docker container.

## Migration Steps Performed

1. Created backup branch: `upgrade/laravel12`
2. Updated Docker configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, nginx config)
3. Updated composer.json dependencies
4. Rebuilt Docker containers with PHP 8.3
5. Ran `composer update` to install Laravel 12
6. Refactored code structure (models, seeders, routes)
7. Cleared all caches
8. Recreated database with fresh MySQL 8.0 volume
9. Ran migrations successfully

## Post-Upgrade Tasks

### Required Manual Steps
1. Review and update any custom middleware in `bootstrap/app.php`
2. Update environment variables if needed
3. Review authentication scaffolding (consider Laravel Breeze or Jetstream)
4. Run database seeders: `php artisan db:seed`
5. Build frontend assets: `npm install && npm run build`
6. Test all application features thoroughly

### Optional Improvements
1. Consider implementing Laravel Pint for code formatting
2. Add Laravel Sail for improved development experience
3. Implement proper API authentication with Laravel Sanctum
4. Update tests to use modern PHPUnit syntax
5. Consider adding Laravel Horizon if using queues

## Known Issues

1. **Database Seeding**: Need to run seeders manually after migration
2. **Frontend Assets**: Need to rebuild with Vite after upgrade
3. **Old Test Files**: Test files in `/tests` need namespace updates for PSR-4 compliance

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migrations complete
- [ ] Database seeders run successfully
- [ ] Frontend assets compile with Vite
- [ ] Application loads in browser
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] All routes are accessible
- [ ] API endpoints function correctly
